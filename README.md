# TANIM
This is a C++ library for making ASCII animations that output to a file. Also, if you want to view the output use Notepad+ or Visual Studio Code.  
They have higher file auto-refresh rates than almost everything else.  

## DEMO
If you want to run the demo (and are not on mac) simply do this:  
1: run this command: g++ -o demo  -std=c++20 screen.cpp animation.cpp utility.cpp  
2: open output.txt in a viewer with a high auto-refresh rate  
3: run ./demo  
If you are on mac, skip step 1.  

## IMPORT
Put the folder into your project, then get rid of these files:  
demo  
output.txt  
Open animation.cpp, and remove the main function.  
Simply compile the cpp files with the rest of the project.
